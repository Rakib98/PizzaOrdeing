# PizzaOrdeing
Ordering system for an hypothetical pizzeria.
It is built by using C# windows Form, and uses a MySQL database to store the login information. username and password are not yet hashed.
The application uses OOP to create pizza, drink and side object.
The app allows to "order" pizza and the topping to have on each pizza, drinks, sides, save customer info and then it will display
a summative checkout.
